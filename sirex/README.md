# SIREX

This is a library to build [Svelte-Integration-Red](https://gitlab.com/2WeltenChris/svelte-integration-red) in alternative way,
the original way is hard to debug when you have a lot of components.

## Precautions

The `.hbs` template used in this libary only have minimum support for handlebars syntax and features, it does not use the full version of handlebars compiler.

Run `yarn build:template` after you update the `.hbs` files.
